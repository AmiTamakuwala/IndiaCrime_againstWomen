Keywords:
* Crimes ratio in Year
*	Crime ratio in different States/UT
* Machine Learning
*	Data Analysis
*	Visualization
*	Crime detection.

METHODOLOGY:
The following modules are there in the proposed work: 
*	Data Requirement Selection
*	 Data Collection 
*	Data Pre-processing
*	Data Analysis
  * Prediction mode
*	Data Interpretation
 	* Data Visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
*	Are there any missing or null Values in the Dataset?
*	How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
*	How many and which are the unique values in the “STATE/UT” column?
*	How should we analyze the data year-wise?
*	What is the total number of crimes between 2001 to 2012?
*	How many total numbers of crimes were registered year-wise? 
*	Can we visualize the total number of crime cases in the year 2001 to 2012?
*	In which year we can see steady changes in the crime against women?
*	Which was the highest reported crime, and which one was the least?
*	What is the ratio of each crime that was registered from 2001 to 2012?
*	How many rows and columns will be there if we are merging the STATE/UT column?
*	Which State/Union Territories were “Highest” with the number of criminal cases against women?
*	Which State/Union Territories were “Lowest” with the number of criminal cases against women?
*	Out Of 7 types of Crimes, which State/UT has the "maximum" cases of each type of crime against women in India between 2001 to 2012?
*	Out Of 7 types of Crimes, which State/UT has the "minimum" cases of each type of crime against women in India between 2001 to 2012?

--> Predictive Modelling:
*	Linear Regression

* Crime detection & Prevention:

* fety Measures:

* Conclusion:

* RAY OF HOPE:
